# DATA-SCIENCE-BOWL-2018
## Find the nuclei in divergent images to advance medical discovery
### Spot Nuclei. Speed Cures.
  Imagine speeding up research for almost every disease, from lung cancer and heart disease to rare disorders. The 2018 Data Science Bowl   offers our most ambitious mission yet: create an algorithm to automate nucleus detection.

  We’ve all seen people suffer from diseases like cancer, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Alzheimer’s, and diabetes.   Many have seen their loved ones pass away. Think how many lives would be transformed if cures came faster.

  By automating nucleus detection, you could help unlock cures faster—from rare disorders to the common cold. 
  
# Deep Learning Tutorial for Kaggle Find the nuclei in divergent images to advance medical discovery competition, using Keras

This tutorial shows how to use [Keras library](http://keras.io/) to build deep neural network for Find the nuclei in divergent images to advance medical discovery
More info on this Kaggle competition can be found on [https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-bowl-2018](https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-bowl-2018).

This deep neural network achieves **~0.298 score on the leaderboard** based on test images,
and can be a good staring point for further, more serious approaches.

The architecture was inspired by [U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation](http://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/people/ronneber/u-net/).
